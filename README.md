## Full-Stack Rust ChatBot

We use Leptos in this project, a Rust web framework. Using tailwind for the UI, client and serverside code in Rust, along with a hugging-face LLM that is supported by Rustformers. 

We use Wizard-Vicuna-7B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin. This LLM from hugging-face is supported by Rustformers. As such, this allows us to use the crate models->Llama, along with the methods and functions to first fine-tune the model; outputting a somewhat acceptable chatbot answer.
